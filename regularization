Why do we need regularization:

If the model is complex , then the overfitting will happen. So we will have high train accuracy but less test accuracy. So we introduce 
regularization to avoid that.

Overfitting:

Overfitting means the model will learn the parameters based on the training sets we provide. It will do well for the training set. But it will
perform very poorly for the test datas. Meaning, the model will fit the parameters strictly for the training set.
